\section{Work}

\triline{\bf Research Assistant}{Flux Research Group}{2014-present}

I work independently and with other graduate students to do research on network
systems. I help design and implement the systems, write publication-quality
technical papers, and guide the direction of the research. I stay up
to date on the latest research in my area by reading technical papers.
While working here I've worked on a number of systems for performing automated
network management and control, as well as a system designed to increase the 
flexibility and security of cloud infrastructure.

\section{Education}

\triline{\bf Bachelors of Computer Science}%
{University of Utah}%
{Expected 2017 \\ \scriptsize (requirements completed) }

3.69 GPA. I was invited to join a graduate research lab as an undergraduate
where I worked on automated network management and control. I helped design
and build a secure control architecture for open access networks using modern
network control technologies like OpenFlow.

\vspace{1.5ex}
\triline{\bf Masters of Computer Science}{University of Utah}{Expected 2017}

My masters degree course of study is focused on increasing the flexibility of 
inter-tenant interactions in a cloud infrastructure while maintaining
strict isolation (specifically, using an object capability system). I've taken
courses in distributed systems engineering, and artificial intelligence.

\section{Awards}

\triline{\small \bf Outstanding Undergraduate \\ Student Researcher}{College of Engineering, \\ University of Utah}{2015}

One of only 17 students to win the award. I was nominated by the professor
I had worked with over the previous year. The award was for my research
conducted on automated network management systems for open access networks.

\section{Publications}

\triline{\small \bf OpenEdge: A Dynamic and Secure \\ Open Service Edge Network}{IEEE NOMS}{2016}

I was the first author, and primary researcher on this project. Myself and a PhD
student cooperated to design and build the OpenEdge system. I also helped to deploy
the system in the test network of an actual regional access network. I presented
this paper at the IEEE NOMS 2016 conference.

\vspace{1ex}
\triline{\small \bf KnowNet: Towards a Knowledge \\ Plane for Enterprise Network \\ Management}{IEEE NOMS}{2016}

For this project I built a knowledge graph from scratch with a novel streaming
response interface that would yield new query results as the graph was updated. 
I also presented this paper at the IEEE NOMS 2016 conference.

\section{Interests}

Distributed systems, networking systems, operating systems, AI and machine learning, 
functional programming, as well as systems more generally.
